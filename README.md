# Sudoku-solver-apps

The aim of this project is to create an application which can take in a sudoku image, solve it, and overlay the application onto the image.

This project is divided into 3 parts:

1. sudoku_solver.py is a file which holds the algorithm for solving the sudoku. It applies a brute force (DFS) approach to solve the sudoku. (Finished)

2. sudoku_solver_app.py is the GUI for the application. It is currently done by Kivy.

3. sudoku_grabber.py is the code for capturing a sudoku puzzle from an image. This will probably be done using OpenCV.
